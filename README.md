This is an extremely simple app whose main purpose is to keep track of the user's weight every day. The main data components needed are the daily weight, the username and password, and the goal weight. This app will feature a graph that shows the user's daily weight each day and the days that they were inserted. A couple of inputs that the app will allow are the daily weight, the goal weight, and if they would like to receive a notification when they hit their goal weight. These features allow the uses to easily see their current and past weights.

I wrote this project by one step at a time. Starting with determining and making the user interface, and then building the Java code which runs the backend of the application. I was able to test each new iteration of my code by using the built in Android emulator inside of Android Studio. By using this, I was able to see the errors in my code or if the application was not working as intended.
